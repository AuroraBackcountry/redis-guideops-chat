# 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Session Sharing Issue

## 🎯 Issue Identified
**ALL messages showing as User 1** because users are sharing the same Flask session due to a weak SECRET_KEY.

## 🔍 Root Cause
- `SECRET_KEY` environment variable was not set
- Flask defaulted to "Optional default value" 
- Weak SECRET_KEY caused session sharing between different users/browsers
- All users appeared as User 1 in message attribution

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Config (`chat/config.py`)
- Added automatic secure SECRET_KEY generation if not set
- Enhanced session security settings
- Added warnings when SECRET_KEY is missing

### 2. Generated Secure Key
A secure SECRET_KEY has been added to your local `.env` file:
```
SECRET_KEY=9e7348f2c037d6d7c192ac76807ec3f16b7815a3b2d0aa42ebbea8a624f2794a
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment Fix

### For Railway Deployment:
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Variables** section
3. Add environment variable:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=9e7348f2c037d6d7c192ac76807ec3f16b7815a3b2d0aa42ebbea8a624f2794a
   ```
4. **Redeploy** your application

### For Other Platforms:
Set the environment variable in your hosting platform:
```bash
export SECRET_KEY=9e7348f2c037d6d7c192ac76807ec3f16b7815a3b2d0aa42ebbea8a624f2794a
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

After redeploying with the SECRET_KEY:

1. **Clear browser sessions**: Have all test users log out and log back in
2. **Test different browsers**: User 1 in Chrome, User 2 in Firefox, User 3 in Safari  
3. **Send messages**: Each user should now show their correct name
4. **Check Redis Streams**: Messages should show correct `user_id` values

### Debug Endpoint
Visit `/v2/debug/session` to verify:
- `secret_key_default: false`
- `session_id` is unique per user
- `user_id` matches the logged-in user

## 📊 Expected Results

After fix:
```
User 1 messages: user_id: "1", username: "Ben Johns"
User 2 messages: user_id: "2", username: "Benjamin Johns"  
User 3 messages: user_id: "3", username: "Martin"
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Restart Required**: Flask application MUST be restarted/redeployed for SECRET_KEY changes to take effect
2. **Session Invalidation**: Existing sessions will be invalidated (users need to log in again)
3. **Security**: Never commit SECRET_KEY to version control - use environment variables only

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if SECRET_KEY is properly set
curl https://your-app-url/v2/debug/session

# Check message attribution in Redis
curl https://your-app-url/v2/system/status
```

This fix resolves the session sharing issue and ensures proper user attribution in messages.
